== Introduction ==

This software predicts DNA curvature from DNA sequences. The curvature is 
calculated as a vector sum of dinucleotide geometries (roll, tilt and twist angles) 
using the BEND algorithm of Godsell and Dickerson, and expressed as degrees per 
helical turn (10.5 °/helical turn = 1 °/basepair).

This calculation - like all predictions - is approximate. Experimentally tested 
curved motifs produce curvature values of 5 to 25 °/helical turn, while straight
motifs give values below 5 °/helical turn.

Basic concepts, references and tips for evaluation are provided, along with 
short examples.

The results are presented in several forms:

a) 1-D sequence plot, in which the curvature and the flexibility or GC content are 
plotted along the DNA sequence with options to smooth the plot

b) 2-D plot, in which the curvature is plotted against flexibility or GC content

c) ASCII (text only) tabulated output of calculated values, sent by e-mail.
